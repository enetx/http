# HTTP/3 upstream maintenance

HTTP/3 is part of the `github.com/enetx/http` module and is imported as
`github.com/enetx/http/http3`. The supported baseline is Go 1.27+.

- Source: [quic-go v0.65.0](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/tree/v0.65.0/http3).
- Upstream commit: `aa265c3fc6489e3bfa8071b333be95e0e887a51d`.
- Previous standalone fork: `ba6a50293c3c477f83648f3faa9e58adaa807206` (`v1.0.9`).

The former repository, including its Git history, is preserved in
`archive/http3/` at the workspace root. Use the shared
[update procedure](../UPSTREAM.md) and [source pins](../upstream.json) for future
updates. HTTP/3 has no separate `go.mod`.

## Audited behavior

Before updating, all production files, local tests and the standalone fork
history were compared against quic-go v0.60.0. The fork had selected later
connection and frame fixes. Its custom changes were in `client.go`, `conn.go`,
`frames.go`, `request_writer.go`, `server.go`, `transport.go`, and the former
`httpcommon` sorter.

Preserve these behaviors when updating:

- Use the fork's HTTP, tracing, test-server and HTTP/3 qlog packages.
- `Header-Order:` controls regular request header order. Listed fields precede
  unlisted fields; unlisted fields sort lexicographically. Multiple values retain
  their order. The stateless sorter in `internal/headerorder` is shared with
  HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.
- `PHeader-Order:` controls pseudo-header order, including `:protocol` for Extended
  CONNECT. The default order is `:authority`, `:method`, `:path`, `:scheme`.
  CONNECT omits `:path` and `:scheme` where the protocol requires it.
- Both order keys are metadata and never reach the wire. Other invalid headers
  remain errors.
- `AdditionalSettings`, `Settings.Other` and `settingsFrame.Other` use
  `g.MapOrd[uint64, uint64]`. Unknown settings preserve insertion order and retain
  duplicate validation. Only qlog snapshots convert them to ordinary maps.
- Clients omit automatic `SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE` while enforcing
  `MaxResponseHeaderBytes` locally. Explicit profile settings remain supported.
- `settingsFrame.Append` emits `MaxFieldSectionSize` only when positive.
  Parsing an explicit peer-supplied zero remains valid. The client initializes
  this field to `-1`, so qlog agrees with its omission from the wire.
- The 0-RTT compatibility check treats zero as omitted, matching the encoder.
- Invalid-header-value errors retain the detailed diagnostics from the fork.

The former pooled sorter has been removed. The shared stateless sorter preserves
its observable order without cached mutable state or a global lock.

## Surf API usage

Surf uses `Transport` with `TLSClientConfig`, `QUICConfig`, `AdditionalSettings`,
`MaxResponseHeaderBytes` and `Dial`, plus `RoundTrip`, `CloseIdleConnections` and
`Close`. Its tests also use `Server`, `Serve` and `Close`.

Surf does not use capsule or `HTTPStreamer` APIs. The old `ParseCapsule` API was
upstream behavior rather than a fork extension and has no compatibility wrapper.
The fork follows the current `NewCapsuleParser` / `CapsuleReader` API,
`HTTPStreamer.HTTPStream` signature and h3-events-14 qlog schema.

## Regression coverage

- `request_writer_order_test.go` and `fork_wire_test.go`: default and custom
  regular/pseudo-header order, CONNECT, Extended CONNECT, QPACK bytes with and
  without qlog, repeated requests, multiple values and omitted metadata.
- `../tests/headerorder/`: shared ordering, partial orders, lexicographic fallback,
  excluded metadata, input immutability and independent calls.
- `frames_settings_test.go` and `fork_wire_test.go`: ordered settings on real
  client/server streams, explicit profiles, omitted/zero/positive header limits,
  peer-supplied zero, qlog snapshots, local limits and 0-RTT compatibility.
- Upstream HTTP/3 and qlog suites, with ordered-setting fixtures and detailed
  error expectations adapted to the fork.

Run validation from the parent `http` module, then from the sibling `surf` module
using its local replacement:

```sh
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
```
